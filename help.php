        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <p>Here are some frequently asked questions/issues of our users and the solutions fro them by our technicians!. Please have a look. You may found your solutions!</p>
        
        <h2>1. Why my computer is not turning on?</h2>
        
        <p>If your PC is a desktop computer and doesn't start, check that it's not the plug socket at fault by plugging it into a different socket. If that does not work, it could be that the power supply in your PC has failed.</p>
        <p>If it is a laptop, a loss of power could result from a battery that has completely run out of charge. So, the first thing to do is to plug it in and leave it to charge for a few hours. If that does not work, it could mean the charger is faulty, so, if you can try a different charger. If the charger has a power indicator, check whether it lights up when you plug it in.</p>
        
        <h2>2.Why my internet is slow?</h2>
        
        <p> Restart the modem.This solution is just like how you would resolve any gadgets. Sometimes a power fluctuation or overused of the internet modem can overload it. 
            In order to reset everything back to normal, simply switch off the modem, wait for few minutes and turn it back on. You should be good to go in most cases.</p>
        <p>Fix your wifi signal.Speaking of wifi, you might find that your router and internet are fine, but your wireless signal is weak. This can cause a slowdown—or, at minimum, a latency-filled browsing experience. 
            In that case, you may need to reposition, tweak, and boost your router with a few tricks.</p>
        
        <h2>3.My PC is becoming slow.</h2>

        <p>With your system full of programs, there will definitely be one or two programs that use lots of your resources, for instance, a ram.
            To find out, open the Task Manager. You can right-click your taskbar and select the “Task Manager” option or press Ctrl+Shift+Escape to open it. On Windows 8, 8.1, and 10.
            Click the “CPU,” “Memory,” and “Disk” headers to sort the list by the applications using the most resources. If any application is using too many resources, you might want to close it normally — if you can't, select it here and click “End Task” to force it to close.</p>
        <p>Autostart programs during system startup can be the major reason why your PC is slowing down.On Windows 8, 8.1, and 10, there's now a startup manager in the Task Manager you can use to manage your startup programs.
           Right-click the taskbar and select “Task Manager” or press Ctrl+Shift+Escape to launch it. Click over to the Startup tab and disable startup applications you don't need.
           Windows will helpfully tell you which applications slow down your startup process the most.</p>

        <h2>4.I am facing errors when updating the Windows.</h2>

        <p>Windows update errors can occur due to a bunch of reasons. Causes include Windows piracy, core files missing, license issues, etc.
         The problem is, however, not that serious. But if you still want to have the latest software and security installed, you have to fix it.
         The solution is quite straight forward. With an in-built error detection and troubleshooting, Windows has its own mechanism to fix this.</p>
        
        <h2>5. I have a noisy hard drive. How to fix that?</h2>

        <p>Usually, when we hear the sound from our computers, it's a hard drive sound. So when the sound suddenly gets louder, we assume that it's from the hard drive.
           To check this, you can simply unplug the power and data cables from the hard drive and reboot the system. If you still hear the sound, the issue is not with the hard drive.</p>
           <p>If you're certain that the sound comes from the hard drive itself, you can run a free hardware diagnostic software which is already available on many computers or available on the internet.</p>
           <p>If the diagnostic software fails, it simply means there is an issue related to the hardware of the drive. If in that case, there is nothing you can do except to replace it.
            Remember to make a back up of your files before replacing it.</p>
